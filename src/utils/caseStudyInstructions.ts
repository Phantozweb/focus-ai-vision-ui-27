   - Review of Systems
   - Past Ocular History
   - Medical History
   - Family History
   - Social History
   - Clinical Findings (visual acuity, etc.)
   - Slit Lamp Examination
   - Diagnostic Tests
   - Assessment with ICD-10 code
   - Plan
   - Follow-up recommendations
   
3. Include realistic clinical values and measurements where appropriate.
4. Incorporate details that require clinical reasoning and analysis.
5. Create cases with appropriate complexity for students, including relevant diagnostic clues.
6. Generate follow-up questions that prompt critical thinking about diagnosis, treatment, and management.
7. Do not reuse case templates or scenarios - create unique cases each time.
8. Ensure medical accuracy and adherence to current clinical guidelines.
9. For each case, generate appropriate practice quiz questions with multiple-choice answers.
